# Linux Learning – Day 1

## Date:
2025-11-07

## Goal:
Understand where I am in the Linux file system and how to move around.

##  Commands Learned:
| Command | Description | Example |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| `pwd` | Print working directory | Shows current folder |
| `ls` | List directory contents | `ls -la` shows all files |
| `cd` | Change directory | `cd /home/user/Desktop` |

## 📝 Notes:
- `pwd` always tells me where I am in the system.
- `ls -la` shows all files, including hidden ones, and permissions.
- `cd` changes directories — very important to navigate the system.

##  Reflection:
Today I started my Linux journey. I practiced moving around directories and listing files. It feels new but exciting. I’ll keep doing 1–2 hours daily.
